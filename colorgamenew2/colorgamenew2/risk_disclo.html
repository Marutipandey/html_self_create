                    <p class="mt-3">Prepayment Booking/Recycling Customer should read and understand the business
                        content carefully
                        before making prepayment bookings (prepayment lock price, payment settlement and shipment)

                        bookings to 777in:</p>
                    <p>1. Before making an appointment/restoring the prepayment business, the customer should complete
                        the real name authentication in the mall and ensure that the name, ID number, bank account
                        number, delivery address and other information filled in are true, accurate and valid;
                        Otherwise, the user will be liable for the consequences of false information.</p>
                    <p>2. Customers can order gold and silver products in advance at the shopping centre. Orders can be
                        cancelled by 01:30 a.m. on the same Saturday. When the customer pays the end payment, the mall
                        receives the final payment and arranges the delivery.</p>
                    <p>If the customer does not pay the final pick-up by 01:30 a.m. on Saturday, the customer is deemed
                        to have made the last offer before the inventory and the booking is cancelled.</p>
                    <p>3. Customers can make an appointment to recycle gold and silver products purchased at the gold
                        point. Pre-purchase recovery requires a credit margin and confirmation of actual possession of
                        gold
                        and silver products purchased from the mall. Customers can cancel their reservation at any time
                        before 01:30 on Saturday and the credit mark will be refunded after deducting the increase or
                        decrease in the value of the goods within the corresponding time.</p>
                    <p>If the customer fails to deliver the goods to a shopping mall or shopping center at the
                        designated collection point by Saturday within the same week, or if the goods delivered do not
                        meet the recycling standard test, the customer will be deemed to have cancelled the reservation
                        recovery and will bear the logistics and testing costs.</p>
